When "CALCULATE" button is clicked, a calculator will pop up where you can make calcualtions towards your life points.

Though simple calculations are great, you can expand on this by writing equations where this benefits most. 

At times, spells/trap/field cards and chaining can be cumbersome to deal with. This is where an equation come into play. 

When writing an equation **please initialize with minus/plus or mutliply followed by parenthesis, ().** The equation must follow these conditions to apply successfully. 

Example: 
- -(2400-1750), the difference between two monsters.
- -(2*2100+250-3000), calculate monster gain in spell/field card effects minus monster ATK damage.
